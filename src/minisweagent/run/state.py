"""Run state primitives shared by preprocess and optimization phases.

Two pieces:

- ``ProcessRegistry`` -- thread-safe registry of in-flight ``subprocess.Popen``
  / ``multiprocessing.Process`` / ``concurrent.futures.Future`` handles. The
  watchdog and SIGINT handler call ``terminate_all()`` here to actually kill
  in-flight work; without this layer, ``soft_stop`` polling alone cannot
  guarantee the finalize grace window because a hung subprocess can sit on the
  GIL-free side indefinitely.

- ``PreprocessState`` -- per-run state for the preprocess phase: the current
  pipeline stage, a few flags read by the soft-stop handler, and a reference
  to the registry so handlers can call ``terminate_all()`` and ``Popen``s can
  be tracked uniformly.

POSIX-only by design (the rest of GEAK is also POSIX-only). All ``Popen``
spawns *must* use ``start_new_session=True`` so we can ``os.killpg`` the whole
group; ``mp.Process`` targets must call ``os.setsid()`` on entry for the same
reason (mp.Process has no equivalent constructor flag).
