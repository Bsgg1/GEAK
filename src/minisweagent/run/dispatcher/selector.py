"""Dispatcher — selects N tasks from a CandidatePool based on mode.

The dispatcher is the **only** component that knows about mode semantics.
Its job is purely selection: from a pool of M candidates, pick N to run
on the available parallel workers.  In mixed mode, K (the number of
planned slots) is determined adaptively based on per-task outcomes from
prior rounds.
